# Bank Loan Analysis Project 📊💡

Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze loan approval patterns, risk assessment, and financial insights using a combination of powerful tools and technologies. The primary objective was to uncover trends that impact loan approvals and risk management by analyzing real-world financial data.

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project leverages data analytics techniques to explore various factors affecting loan applications and approvals. By applying statistical analysis and predictive modeling, the project provides a comprehensive analysis of approval probabilities and financial risk factors. The tools and techniques used in this project help uncover patterns that influence decision-making in financial institutions.

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies Used
	•	Excel: Used for data preprocessing and identifying key trends in loan applications.
	•	Python (Jupyter Notebook): Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced statistical analysis. Also used for data visualization and building predictive models to gain deeper insights into loan approval probabilities.
	•	SQL Server: Designed and executed complex queries to extract and manipulate structured loan data, supporting better decision-making.
	•	Power BI Desktop: Built interactive dashboards and reports to visualize loan trends, borrower risk factors, and key business insights.
	•	Microsoft Word: Created a detailed project report documenting the analysis, methodologies, and key findings.
